# CS50 Foundations

Technical implementations and low-level programming exercises from the CS50 curriculum. This repository documents core computer science principles and algorithmic logic using the C programming language.

## Repository Contents

temp.c
    Celsius to Fahrenheit converter. Implemented using custom functions 
    and floating-point arithmetic to ensure precision.

tip.c
    Tip percentage calculator. Focuses on function return values 
    and modular arithmetic logic.

parity.c
    Even or odd number checker. Implements the modulo operator 
    within conditional logic blocks.

agree.c
    User input validation handler. Demonstrates character input 
    processing and logical OR operators.

calculator.c
    Basic arithmetic operations platform. Establishes fundamentals 
    of C data types and standard I/O.

points.c
    Logic comparison exercise. Focuses on variable casing 
    standards and syntax structure.

## Usage

Programs should be compiled and executed using the CS50/make utility:

1. Compilation:
   make <filename_without_extension>

2. Execution:
   ./<filename_without_extension>
